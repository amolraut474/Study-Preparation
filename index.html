        // HTML Questions
        { category: 'html', question: "What is HTML?", answer: "HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's the standard markup language used to create and design web pages." },
        { category: 'html', question: "Can you explain the purpose of the doctype declaration in HTML?", answer: "The doctype declaration, usually seen at the beginning of an HTML document ( DOCTYPE html), informs the browser about the version of HTML being used and helps it render the document correctly. It ensures that the browser interprets the HTML markup according to the appropriate specifications, minimizing rendering errors and ensuring consistency across different browsers." },
        { category: 'html', question: "What are the key differences between inline and block-level elements in HTML?", answer: "Inline elements are elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include span, a, and img. Block-level elements, on the other hand, start on a new line and occupy the full width available. Examples include div, p, and h1 tags." },

        { category: 'html', question: "What are the new features introduced in HTML5?", answer: "HTML5 introduced several new features including semantic elements (like header, footer, nav, etc.), audio and video support without plugins, canvas for drawing graphics, local storage, geolocation, and more." },

        { category: 'html', question: "Explain the purpose of the meta tag in HTML.", answer: "The meta tag is used to provide metadata about an HTML document, such as character encoding, author, description, keywords, and viewport settings for responsive web design." },

        { category: 'html', question: "What are the different types of lists in HTML?", answer: "HTML supports three types of lists: ordered lists (ol), unordered lists (ul), and definition lists (dl)." },

        { category: 'html', question: "What is the difference between div and span in HTML?", answer: "'div' is a block-level element used to group larger sections of content, while 'span' is an inline element used to apply styles or group smaller sections of text within a line." },

        { category: 'html', question: "What are semantic elements in HTML? Give some examples.", answer: "Semantic elements provide meaning to the content they enclose, making it more understandable for both developers and browsers. Examples include header, footer, nav, article, section, aside, and main." },

        { category: 'html', question: "What are HTML tags?", answer: "HTML tags are elements used to mark up the content of a web page, defining its structure and formatting. They consist of angle brackets surrounding a keyword, which represents the function or purpose of the tag. HTML tags are paired, with an opening tag and a closing tag, and they enclose content to which they apply. Some tags may be self-closing if they don't contain any content." },

        { category: 'html', question: "What is a marquee in HTML?", answer: "Marquee is used for scrolling text on a web page. It scrolls the image or text up, down, left, or right automatically. To apply for a marquee, you have to use marquee tags." },

        { category: 'html', question: "Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?", answer: "No, HTML tags are used to define the structure of a web page, while HTML elements are made up of a set of tags that define a specific part of a web page." },

        { category: 'html', question: "What are the various heading tags and their importance?", answer: "There are 6 levels of headings defined by HTML. These six heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6; with H1 being at the highest level and H6 at the least." },
        { category: 'html', question: "Difference between id and class attribute?", answer: "The only difference between them is that 'id' is unique on a page and can only apply to at most one element, while the 'class' selector can apply to multiple elements." },
        { category: 'html', question: "What is the <meta> tag used for?", answer: "The <meta> tag is used to provide meta-information about the HTML document, such as character set, author, description, keywords, and viewport settings for responsive design." },
        { category: 'html', question: "What is an anchor tag in HTML?", answer: "The <a> tag (anchor tag) in HTML is used to create a hyperlink on the webpage. This hyperlink is used to link the webpage to other web pages. Itâ€™s either used to provide an absolute reference or a relative reference as its 'href' value." },
        { category: 'html', question: "How to change an inline element into a block-level element?", answer: "We can accomplish this task by using the display property having its value as 'block', to change the element from inline to block-level element." },
        { category: 'html', question: "What is the difference between <strong>, <b> tags and <em>, <i> tags?", answer: "The effect on a normal webpage of the tags <strong>, <b> and <em>, <i> is the same. <b> and <i> tags stand for bold and italic. These two tags only apply font styling and the bold tag <b> just adds more ink to the text; these tags don't say anything about the text. Whereas, <strong> and <em> tags represent that the span of text is of strong importance or more importance and emphatic stress respectively than the rest of the text. These tags have semantic meaning." },
        { category: 'html', question: "In how many ways can we position an HTML element? Or what are the permissible values of the position attribute?", answer: "There are mainly 7 values of the position attribute that can be used to position an HTML element: (1) static: Default value. Here the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. (2) absolute: Here the element is positioned relative to its parent element. The final position is determined by the values of left, right, top, bottom. (3) fixed: This is similar to absolute except here the elements are positioned relative to the <html> element. (4) relative: Here the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document and positioned relative to its original/normal position. (5) initial: This resets the property to its default value. (6) inherit: Here the element inherits or takes the property of its parent."},

               // CSS Questions
         { category: 'css', question: "What is CSS?", answer: "CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.Itâ€™s a style sheet language that determines how the elements/contents in the page are looked/shown. CSS is used to develop a consistent look and feel for all the pages." },

        { category: 'css', question: "How can you center an element horizontally and vertically in CSS?", answer: "To center an element horizontally, you can set its margin property to auto and specify a width for the element. For vertical centering, you can use the CSS Flexbox layout or the position property along with the top, bottom, left, and right properties to position the element at 50% from the top and then use the transform property with the translateY(-50%) value to center it vertically." },

        { category: 'css', question: "Explain the concept of the CSS Box Model.", answer: "The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes the layout of HTML elements on a web page. It consists of four main components: content, padding, border, and margin. The content area contains the actual content of the element, surrounded by padding, which creates space between the content and the border. The border outlines the padding and content, and the margin provides space between the element's border and other elements on the page." },

        { category: 'css', question: "What are CSS selectors, and how do they work?", answer: "CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements based on their attributes, IDs, classes, or element types. Selectors target specific elements in an HTML document, allowing developers to apply styles selectively. For example, the element selector targets all instances of a specific HTML element type, the .class selector targets elements with a specific class, and the #id selector targets elements with a specific ID attribute." },

        { category: 'css', question: "What is the difference between classes and IDs in CSS?", answer: "Classes and IDs are both used to apply styles to HTML elements, but they have some key differences. Classes can be applied to multiple elements, allowing for reusable styles across different parts of a web page. IDs, on the other hand, should be unique within a page and are typically used to target a specific element for styling or JavaScript interactions. Additionally, IDs have higher specificity in CSS compared to classes." },

        { category: 'css', question: "What are CSS Grid and Flexbox, and when would you use each?", answer: "CSS Grid and Flexbox are layout systems in CSS used for creating complex and responsive layouts. Flexbox: Ideal for arranging items within a single-dimensional layout (either in rows or columns). It's well-suited for aligning items within a container and distributing space among them. Flexbox is great for navigation bars, card layouts, or any UI component where content needs to be dynamically aligned. CSS Grid: Provides a two-dimensional grid-based layout system, allowing precise control over both rows and columns. It's best used for overall page layout, where elements need to be placed in specific grid areas or have more complex alignment requirements." },

        { category: 'css', question: "Can you explain the concept of 'float' in CSS?", answer: "The float property in CSS is used to align elements horizontally within their container. It's commonly used for creating layouts where elements can wrap around each other, like in multi-column designs or floating images within text. However, it's important to note that floats can lead to layout issues, such as clearing floats properly to avoid unintended overlap or misalignment, which may require additional CSS or clearfix techniques to address." },

        { category: 'css', question: "How would you implement a responsive layout using CSS?", answer: "To create a responsive layout, I would use media queries to apply different styles based on the viewport width. By setting breakpoints and adjusting styles accordingly, I can ensure that the layout adapts smoothly to various screen sizes. Additionally, I would utilize flexible units like percentages, viewport units, or flexbox/grid layout to create fluid and adaptable designs." },

        { category: 'css', question: "Explain the difference between inline and block-level elements.", answer: "Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. They only take up as much width as necessary and do not force line breaks. Examples include span, a, and img. Block-level elements, on the other hand, start on a new line and occupy the full width available. They create a visual block on the page. Examples include div, p, and h1-h6." },

        { category: 'css', question: "What are pseudo-classes in CSS?", answer: "Pseudo-classes are keywords that specify a special state of an element. They allow you to style elements based on user interaction or document structure that can't be targeted using ordinary selectors. Examples include :hover, :active, :focus, and :nth-child()." },

        { category: 'css', question: "What is the difference between margin and padding?", answer: "Margin is the space outside the border of an element, while padding is the space between the content of an element and its border. Margin creates space between elements, while padding creates space within an element." },

        { category: 'css', question: "What do you understand by the universal selector?", answer: "A universal selector is a selector that matches any element type's name instead of selecting elements of a particular type." },

        { category: 'css', question: "What is the use of CSS Opacity?", answer: "The CSS opacity property is used to specify the transparency of an element. In simple word, you can say that it specifies the clarity of the image. In technical terms, Opacity is defined as the degree to which light is allowed to travel through an object." },

        { category: 'css', question: "Explain the difference between visibility: hidden and display: none?", answer: "visibility: hidden hides the element, but it occupies space and affects the layout of the document. display: none also hides the element but not occupy space. It will not affect the layout of the document." },

        { category: 'css', question: "What are the position states in CSS?", answer: "The four-position states in CSS are relative, static, absolute, and fixed. The default position state is static." },
        { category: 'css', question: "Differentiate between absolute and relative in CSS.", answer: "The main difference is that relative is used for the same tag in CSS. If we write right:20 px, then padding shifts 20 px in the right. Whereas absolute is relative to the non-static parent, i.e., if we write right:20 px, the result will be 20 px far from the right edge of the parent element." },
     // JavaScript Questions

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What is JavaScript?", answer: "JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language. JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building interactive web applications." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What is JavaScript, and what are its key features?", answer: "JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building interactive web applications. Its key features include: Client-side scripting: JavaScript runs on the client's browser, allowing for dynamic interaction with web pages. Lightweight and versatile: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple DOM manipulation to complex web application development. Object-oriented: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming paradigms, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Asynchronous programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous operations through callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax, enabling non-blocking I/O operations." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What is the difference between 'undefined' and 'null' in JavaScript?", answer: "In JavaScript, 'undefined' means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It's a primitive data type. On the other hand, 'null' is an assignment value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It's also a primitive data type, but explicitly indicates a lack of value." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What is hoisting in JavaScript?", answer: "Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means you can access variables and functions before they are declared. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "Explain closures in JavaScript and provide an example.", answer: "Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables, even after the outer function has finished executing. They encapsulate and preserve the state of a function's lexical environment. Here's an example: function outerFunction() { let outerVariable = 'I am outer'; function innerFunction() { console.log(outerVariable); } return innerFunction; } let closureExample = outerFunction(); closureExample(); // Output: I am outer" },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What are the differences between '==' and '===' operators in JavaScript?", answer: "In JavaScript, '==' is the equality operator, which checks if two values are equal after performing type coercion if necessary. '===' is the strict equality operator, which checks if two values are equal without performing type coercion. Using '===' is generally preferred because it avoids unexpected type conversions." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What are the different ways to define variables in JavaScript?", answer: "In JavaScript, you can define variables using the var, let, or const keywords. var is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned. let and const are block-scoped; let variables can be reassigned, while const variables cannot be reassigned once declared." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What are the differences between promises and async/await in JavaScript?", answer: "Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They allow for chaining asynchronous operations and handling success and error cases. Async/await is a syntactic sugar built on top of promises, allowing for asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous-like manner. It makes asynchronous code easier to read and write by using the async and await keywords." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What are higher-order functions in JavaScript?", answer: "Higher-order functions are functions that either take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. They enable functional programming paradigms such as map, filter, reduce, and compose. Higher-order functions promote code reusability, modularity, and the creation of expressive and concise code." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "Explain the 'this' keyword in JavaScript.", answer: "In JavaScript, the value of the this keyword is determined by how a function is called, not where it's defined. It refers to the object that is executing the current function. The value of this can be influenced by function invocation patterns such as method invocation, function invocation, constructor invocation, or using the call, apply, or bind methods." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What are the different data types in JavaScript?", answer: "JavaScript has several data types, including: Primitive types: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol (added in ECMAScript 6). Object types: object, array, function, date, regexp, and more." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What is the difference between let, const, and var?", answer: "var is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned. let and const are block-scoped; let variables can be reassigned, while const variables cannot be reassigned once declared." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What are arrays in JavaScript, and how do you access and manipulate array elements?", answer: "AArrays are ordered collections of values, represented by square brackets [ ]. You can access array elements using bracket notation (arr[index]) and manipulate them using various methods like push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice(), and slice()." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "Explain the concept of functions in JavaScript.", answer: "Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that can be invoked with specific arguments. They can be defined using the function keyword or arrow function syntax (() => { }). Functions can accept parameters and return values, making them versatile tools for organizing and executing code logic." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What is the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript?", answer: "The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects, where each object represents a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text nodes. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically update or modify the content, structure, and style of web pages." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What are conditional statements in JavaScript?", answer: "Conditional statements, such as if, else if, and else, allow you to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions. JavaScript evaluates the condition provided in the if statement, and if it's true, the corresponding block of code is executed. If the condition is false, JavaScript moves to the next else if or else statement, if present." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "Explain call(), apply() and bind() methods.", answer: "call method: The call method is used to invoke a function and specify the value of this explicitly. It accepts the context object as its first argument, followed by any additional arguments to be passed to the function. Here's an example: const obj = { name: 'John' }; function greet(message) { console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}!`); } greet.call(obj, 'Hello'); // Output: Hello, John! apply method: Similar to call, the apply method is used to invoke a function and specify the value of this. However, it accepts an array or array-like object as its second argument, which is passed as individual arguments to the function. Here's an example: const obj = { name: 'Alice' }; function greet(message, punctuation) { console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}${punctuation}`); } greet.apply(obj, ['Hi', '!']); // Output: Hi, Alice! bind method: The bind method is used to create a new function with a specified context (the value of this) without invoking it immediately. It returns a new function with the bound context, which can be called later. Here's an example: const obj = { name: 'Emily' }; function greet(message) { console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}!`); } const boundGreet = greet.bind(obj); boundGreet('Hey'); // Output: Hey, Emily! Additionally, bind can also partially apply arguments to a function: const obj = { name: 'Bob' }; function greet(message, punctuation) { console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}${punctuation}`); } const boundGreet = greet.bind(obj, 'Good morning'); boundGreet('!'); // Output: Good morning, Bob! Use call when you want to invoke a function immediately with a specific context and pass arguments individually. Use apply when you want to invoke a function immediately with a specific context and pass arguments as an array. Use bind when you want to create a new function with a specific context without invoking it immediately, optionally with partially applied arguments." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What are callbacks?", answer: "A callback is a function that will be executed after another function gets executed. In javascript, functions are treated as first-class citizens, they can be used as an argument of another function, can be returned by another function, and can be used as a property of an object." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What are the types of errors in JavaScript?", answer: "TSyntax error: Syntax errors are mistakes or spelling problems in the code that cause the program to not execute at all or to stop running halfway through. Error messages are usually supplied as well. Logical error: Reasoning mistakes occur when the syntax is proper but the logic or program is incorrect. The application executes without problems in this case. However, the output findings are inaccurate. These are sometimes more difficult to correct than syntax issues since these applications do not display error signals for logic faults." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What are arrow functions?", answer: "Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. They provide us with a new and shorter syntax for declaring functions. Arrow functions can only be used as a function expression. Letâ€™s compare the normal function declaration and the arrow function declaration in detail: // Traditional Function Expression var add = function(a,b){ return a + b; } // Arrow Function Expression var arrowAdd = (a,b) => a + b; Arrow functions are declared without the function keyword. If there is only one returning expression then we donâ€™t need to use the return keyword as well in an arrow function as shown in the example above. Also, for functions having just one line of code, curly braces { } can be omitted." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What is the rest parameter and spread operator?", answer: "Both rest parameter and spread operator were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. Rest parameter ( â€¦ ): It provides an improved way of handling the parameters of a function. Using the rest parameter syntax, we can create functions that can take a variable number of arguments. Any number of arguments will be converted into an array using the rest parameter. It also helps in extracting all or some parts of the arguments. Rest parameters can be used by applying three dots (...) before the parameters. function extractingArgs(...args){ return args[1]; } // extractingArgs(8,9,1); // Returns 9 function addAllArgs(...args){ let sumOfArgs = 0; let i = 0; while(i < args.length){ sumOfArgs +=args[i]; i++; } return sumOfArgs; } addAllArgs(6, 5, 7, 99); // Returns 117 addAllArgs(1, 3, 4); // Returns 8 Spread operator (â€¦): Although the syntax of the spread operator is exactly the same as the rest parameter, the spread operator is used to spreading an array, and object literals. We also use spread operators where one or more arguments are expected in a function call. function addFourNumbers(num1,num2,num3,num4){ return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4; } let fourNumbers=[5, 6, 7, 8]; addFourNumbers(...fourNumbers); // Spreads [5,6,7,8] as 5,6,7,8 let array1=[3, 4, 5, 6]; let clonedArray1=[...array1]; // Spreads the array into 3,4,5,6 console.log(clonedArray1); // Outputs [3,4,5,6] let obj1={x:'Hello', y:'Bye'}; let clonedObj1={...obj1}; // Spreads and clones obj1 console.log(obj1); let obj2={z:'Yes', a:'No'}; let mergedObj={...obj1, ...obj2}; // Spreads both the objects and merges it console.log(mergedObj); // Outputs {x:'Hello', y:'Bye',z:'Yes',a:'No'}; Key differences between rest parameter and spread operator: Rest parameter is used to take a variable number of arguments and turns them into an array while the spread operator takes an array or an object and spreads it Rest parameter is used in function declaration whereas the spread operator is used in function calls." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "In JavaScript, how many different methods can you make an object?", answer: "In JavaScript, there are several ways to declare or construct an object. Object. using Class. create Method. Object Literals. using Function. Object Constructor." },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "What is Object Destructuring?", answer: "Object destructuring is a new way to extract elements from an object or an array. Object destructuring: Before ES6 version: const classDetails = { strength: 78, benches: 39, blackBoard:1 } const classStrength = classDetails.strength; const classBenches = classDetails.benches; const classBlackBoard = classDetails.blackBoard; The same example using object destructuring: const classDetails = { strength: 78, benches: 39, blackBoard:1 } const {strength:classStrength, benches:classBenches,blackBoard:classBlackBoard} = classDetails; console.log(classStrength); // Outputs 78 console.log(classBenches); // Outputs 39 console.log(classBlackBoard); // Outputs 1" },

        { category: 'javascript', question: "Is JavaScript a pass-by-reference or pass-by-value language?", answer: "The variable's data is always a reference for objects, hence it's always pass by value. As a result, if you supply an object and alter its members inside the method, the changes continue outside of it. It appears to be pass by reference in this case. However, if you modify the values of the object variable, the change will not last, demonstrating that it is indeed passed by value." },

          { category: 'react', question: "What is React.js?", answer: "React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What are the key features of React.js?", answer: "JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax for defining components. Virtual DOM for efficient rendering. Component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability. Unidirectional data flow with Flux/Redux for managing state. React Native for building mobile applications." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What is JSX?", answer: "JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in React components. JSX gets compiled to JavaScript code that React can understand." },

        { category: 'react', question: "Explain the concept of Virtual DOM.", answer: "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM in memory. When there are updates to the UI, React first updates the Virtual DOM instead of the actual DOM. Then, it calculates the difference between the previous Virtual DOM and the updated Virtual DOM (reconciliation) and applies only the necessary changes to the actual DOM, resulting in improved performance." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What are components in React?", answer: "Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, independent pieces of UI that can be composed together to create complex UIs. Components can be either functional (stateless) or class-based (stateful)." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What is the difference between state and props in React?", answer: "State is managed within a component and can be modified over time. It is mutable. Props (short for properties) are passed to a component from its parent and remain fixed throughout the component's lifecycle. They are immutable." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What is the purpose of keys in React lists?", answer: "Keys are used to uniquely identify elements in an array of JSX elements. They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed. Keys should be stable, unique, and consistent." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What is the significance of setState() method in React?", answer: "setState() is used to update the state of a component. It merges the provided object into the component's current state and triggers a re-render of the component and its children with the updated state." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What are controlled components in React?", answer: "Controlled components are components whose form elements (like inputs, selects, and textareas) are controlled by React state. Changes to the input values are handled by React, and the component's state is updated accordingly." },

        { category: 'react', question: "How does React Router work?", answer: "React Router is a routing library for React applications. It enables navigation and routing in single-page applications by mapping URLs to different React components. It provides components like ,BrowserRouter, ,Route, and ,Link, for defining routes and navigating between them." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What are React hooks? How do they differ from class components?", answer: "React hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. The most commonly used hooks are useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer." },
        
        { category: 'react', question: "Explain the useEffect hook and its equivalents in class components.", answer: "useEffect is used to perform side effects in functional components. It combines componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in a single hook. It takes two arguments: a function and an optional array of dependencies. The function runs after every render, and the dependencies array allows you to specify when the effect should run." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What is Redux? How does it work with React?", answer: "Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps manage the state of an application in a predictable way by enforcing a strict unidirectional data flow. React interacts with Redux using the react-redux library, which provides components like Provider and connect to integrate Redux with React components." },

        { category: 'react', question: "Explain the use of render method in React.", answer: "React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called render(). The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element. In the render() method, we can read props and state and return our JSX code to the root component of our app." },

        { category: 'react', question: "Explain props in React.", answer: "React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called props (which stands for properties). Props are objects which can be used inside a component We can access any props inside from the componentâ€™s class to which the props is passed. The props can be accessed as shown below: this.props.propName;" },

        { category: 'react', question: "Explain the difference between functional and class component in React.", answer: "Functional Components:-(1).A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument(2)No render method used(3)Also known as Stateless components(4)React lifecycle methods (for example, componentDidMount) cannot be used in functional components.(5)Constructors are not used.Class Components:-(1)A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function(2)It must have the render() method returning JSX(3)Also known as Stateful components(4)React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components (for example, componentDidMount).(5) Constructor is used as it needs to store state." },

        { category: 'react', question: "Explain one way data binding in React.", answer: "ReactJS uses one-way data binding which can be Component to View or View to Component. It is also known as one-way data flow, which means the data has one, and only one way to be transferred to other parts of the application. In essence, this means child components are not able to update the data that is coming from the parent component. It is easy to debug and less prone to errors." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What is the difference between useRef and createRef in React?", answer: "useRef:-(1)It is a hook.(2)It uses the same ref throughout.(3)It saves its value between re-renders in a functional component.(4)It returns a mutable ref object.(5)The refs created using the useRef can persist for the entire component lifetime.(6)It is used in functional components. createRef:-(1)It is a function.(2)It creates a new ref every time.(3)It creates a new ref for every re-render.(4)It returns a read-only ref object.(5)The refs created using the createRef can be referenced throughout the component.(6)It is used in class components." },
        
        { category: 'react', question: "What is react-redux?", answer: "React-redux is a state management tool which makes it easier to pass these states from one component to another irrespective of their position in the component tree and hence prevents the complexity of the application. As the number of components in our application increases it becomes difficult to pass state as props to multiple components. To overcome this situation we use react-redux" },

        { category: 'react', question: "What is the difference between Virtual DOM and Real DOM?", answer: "Virtual DOM:-(1)Changes can be made easily.(2)Minimal memory wastage.(3)JSX element is updated if the element exists.(4)Cannot update HTML directly.(5)Faster updates. Real DOM:-(1)Changes can be expensive.(2)High demand for memory and more wastage.(3)	Creates a new DOM every time an element gets updated.(4)Able to directly manipulate HTML.(5)Slow updates." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What are some important features of React?", answer: "React has multiple features that are used for unique purposes. The important ones are as mentioned below: React makes use of a single-direction data flow model. It deals with complete server-side data processing and handling. React uses a Virtual DOM, which has many advantages of its own." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What is the difference between .js and .jsx files in React.js?", answer: "In React.js, both .js and .jsx files are used to write JavaScript code for React components. However, there is a convention to use .jsx file extension for files that contain JSX syntax, while .js extension is typically used for regular JavaScript files. .js Files: Files with a .js extension are regular JavaScript files that can contain JavaScript code, including React components written using JSX. However, JSX syntax is not natively recognized by JavaScript engines, so in order to use JSX in .js files, a preprocessor like Babel is required to transpile JSX code into regular JavaScript. .jsx Files: Files with a .jsx extension are also JavaScript files, but they are specifically intended for React components written using JSX syntax. JSX is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to describe UI components. JSX code is transformed into regular JavaScript using tools like Babel, which converts JSX elements into React.createElement() function calls." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What is the purpose of the setState() method?", answer: "The setState() method is used to update the state of a component in React. When setState() is called, React re-renders the component and its children with the updated state." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What are the features of React?", answer: "(1)JSX (2)Components (3)One-way Data Binding (4)Virtual DOM (5)Simplicity (6)Performance." },

        { category: 'react', question: "List some of the major advantages of React.", answer: "(1)Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI. By comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM and only updating the parts that have changed, React minimizes the number of DOM manipulations, resulting in improved performance and faster rendering. (2)Component-Based Architecture: React follows a component-based architecture, where UIs are composed of reusable and composable components. Components encapsulate both UI and behavior, making code organization and maintenance easier. This approach promotes reusability, modularity, and scalability, allowing developers to build complex UIs by composing smaller components. (3)JSX (JavaScript XML): JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX simplifies the process of defining React components by enabling the mixing of UI elements and JavaScript logic in a single file. It improves code readability, reduces syntax errors, and facilitates the development of UIs. (4)Unidirectional Data Flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow architecture, where data flows in a single direction from parent components to child components. This ensures predictable data flow and makes it easier to debug and reason about the application's state. Unidirectional data flow also helps prevent unexpected side effects and makes the application more maintainable. (5)State Management: React provides a mechanism for managing component state, allowing components to maintain their own internal state. State is used to represent data that can change over time, such as user input or UI interactions. By managing state at the component level, React enables the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces. (6)Reusable Components: React encourages the creation of reusable components, which can be easily shared and composed to build complex UIs. Components encapsulate both UI and behavior, making them self-contained and portable. Reusable components promote code reusability, reduce duplication, and accelerate development time. (7)React Hooks: React Hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features without writing a class. Hooks enable functional components to have local state, side effects, and access to React lifecycle methods. They provide a more intuitive way to manage state and lifecycle in functional components, making them more powerful and flexible. (8)Large Ecosystem and Community Support: React has a large and active community of developers, which contributes to its extensive ecosystem of libraries, tools, and resources. The React ecosystem includes popular libraries like React Router for routing, Redux for state management, and React Native for building cross-platform mobile apps. The vibrant community provides support, documentation, and regular updates, ensuring the longevity and stability of React." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What are the limitations of React?", answer: "Limitations of React are listed below: React is just a library, not a full-blown framework Its library is very large and takes time to understand It can be little difficult for the novice programmers to understand Coding gets complex as it uses inline templating and JSX." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What are Higher Order Components (HOC)?", answer: "Higher-order components (HOCs) are a powerful feature of the React library. They allow you to reuse component logic across multiple components. In React, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component that wraps the original component." },

        { category: 'react', question: "What is the difference between a stateless component and a stateful component in React?", answer: "Stateless Component: This type of component doesn't have its own memory. It's like a function that just takes some inputs (props) and returns what the UI should look like based on those inputs. It's simple and focused on displaying information. Stateful Component: Unlike the stateless one, this component does have a memory. It can keep track of information (state) and use that information to change what it shows in the UI. It's more like a dynamic entity that can respond to user input or other events." },

        { category: 'react', question: "Explain React.js lifecycle methods.", answer: "Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. Mounting:-Mounting means putting elements into the DOM. React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component: constructor():-The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other initial values. getDerivedStateFromProps():-The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM. render():-The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM. componentDidMount():-The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered. render:- The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM. Updating:-The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated. A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props. React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated: getDerivedStateFromProps():-Also at updates the getDerivedStateFromProps method is called. This is the first method that is called when a component gets updated. shouldComponentUpdate():-In the shouldComponentUpdate() method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not. render():-The render() method is of course called when a component gets updated, it has to re-render the HTML to the DOM, with the new changes. The example below has a button that changes the favorite color to blue: getSnapshotBeforeUpdate():-In the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method you have access to the props and state before the update, meaning that even after the update, you can check what the values were before the update. componentDidUpdate():-The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM. The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them Unmounting:-The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted: componentWillUnmount():-The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM." },
